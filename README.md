# RNAseq_workshop
#RNA-seq is an experimental technique that is utilized to explore and/or quantify gene expression within or between conditions. This workshop will introduce participants to RNA-seq data and teach them the following: 

-Different Types of RNA 
-What is RNA-seq 
-Basic Workflow to analyze RNA-seq data 
-Align, filter, and count RNA-seq reads on Big Purple 
-Analyze aligned RNA-seq data in R to obtain differentially expressed genes 

 

#Prior to Workshop: Please request NYU Big Purple HPC account and have R & RStudio Desktop downloaded prior to workshop
